# Problem: Asynchronous Data Aggregator

## Background

You are working on a backend service that needs to aggregate data from multiple sources asynchronously and efficiently.

## Task

**Asynchronous Data Fetching**: Create a function named aggregateData. This function should make parallel asynchronous calls to multiple data sources. You can simulate these data sources as functions returning Promises, each resolving after a random delay with some mock data.

**Aggregation Logic**: Once all data sources have responded, the aggregateData function should combine the results into a single structure. Define the structure of the aggregated result based on the mock data you create.

**Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in the aggregateData function. If any data source fails, handle the error gracefully and include an error message in the aggregated result, without failing the entire aggregation process.

**Timeout Feature**: Add a timeout feature to the aggregation process. If the data from any source is not received within a specified timeout period, proceed with the aggregation without that piece of data, and include a timeout message in the final result.

**Types/Interfaces**: Use interfaces and types to define the structure of the input and output data. Ensure your implementation is type-safe.

**Comments and Documentation**: Write clear comments and documentation for your function, explaining the logic and how to use it.

## Requirements

- Use an explicitly typed languge for the implementation.
- Simulate data sources as asynchronous functions returning Promises.
- Ensure your code is well-organized and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

### Bonus

- Write unit tests for your aggregateData function, testing scenarios like successful data aggregation, handling of errors, and timeouts.
- Implement a retry mechanism for the data sources in case of failure, with a maximum number of retry attempts.

This exercise will test your ability to handle asynchronous operations, manage concurrency, implement error handling and timeouts, and structure your code effectively. It also gives you an opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of type systems for ensuring type safety and clarity in your code.
